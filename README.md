# BitCam 📸
> **A Skeuomorphic Retro Camera & Voxel Art Generator**

BitCam is a zero-configuration, single-page progressive web application (PWA) that transforms your photos — or your **live camera feed** — into textured voxel block mosaics and nostalgic pixel art in real-time.

*Inspired by the blocky, retro aesthetic of classic voxel sandboxes.*

### 🔒 100% Local & Private
**Your images never leave your device.** The entire pixelation, block mapping, and color quantization pipeline runs locally in your web browser (using client-side canvas pixels). There is no backend server, and no image data is ever uploaded, stored, or processed externally.

### 📱 Mobile Experience & Desktop Prompt
BitCam is styled to represent a physical handheld toy camera. If accessed via a desktop computer or laptop, the viewfinder screen will display a warning dialog containing a dynamic QR code. Scanning this code lets you instantly open the app on your mobile phone to experience the simulator correctly.

## 📷 Live Camera Mode

BitCam supports real-time pixel art rendering from your device's rear camera:

- **Tap 📷 CAM** to start the live camera feed — the viewfinder applies the active pixel art filter (16 BIT or 8 BIT) to every frame in real-time.
- **Tap the Shutter button** to freeze the current frame as a snapshot for saving or sharing.
- **Tap the Shutter again** to resume the live feed.
- **Tap ✕ EXIT** to stop the camera and return to the photo upload screen.

Live mode renders at 480px max resolution for smooth ~15-20 FPS performance on most mobile devices.

## 🎨 2000s Skeuomorphic UI Design
Rather than a modern flat interface, the app is styled as an interactive physical digital toy camera gadget:
- **Device Casing**: Styled with brushed-metal chassis gradients, inner beveled highlights, and a translucent atomic-cyan grip strip.
- **Physical Utility Keys**: 3D beveled metallic buttons for **📷 CAM**, **REFRESH / CAPTURE**, and **💾 SAVE** that displace vertically when clicked.
- **Glowing LED Indicators**: Tactile lights indicating device power and calculation state. The "READY" LED glows bright green when the pixel art has compiled.
- **Viewfinder HUD Overlays**: Monospaced green LCD indicators printing the battery capacity `[▰▰▰] 100%`, active camera mode `● ACTIVE`, a retro calendar timestamp, and photo quality (`HQ 16b`).
- **Style Selector HUD**: A clean, bottom-centered glassmorphism menu toggle that swaps rendering modes between **16 BIT** and **8 BIT**.

## ⚙️ How the Block Art Engine Works

BitCam processes the loaded image (or live camera frame) in real-time through a client-side voxelization pipeline:

### 1. Grid Partitioning & Color Averaging
*   The source is downscaled to fit the camera viewfinder, then divided into discrete grid cell blocks of size `12px`.
*   The engine calculates the average RGB color of the pixels inside each cell bounds to determine the primary tone.

### 2. Dual Pixelation Styles

#### 👾 16 BIT Mode (Smooth Flat Pixel Art)
*   Standard color-pixelation block rendering.
*   Clamps the colors into a 5-6-5 bit (16-bit) High Color depth, yielding exactly 65,536 colors for a retro Windows 95/98 PC gaming look.

#### 🧱 8 BIT Mode (Procedural Voxel Block Art)
*   **Procedural Block Texture Compiler**: Generates authentic 16x16 pixel textures dynamically on startup with zero network dependencies (includes *Stone, Grass, Dirt, Leaves, Water, Sand, Wood, and Obsidian*).
*   **Euclidean Color-Proximity Check**: Compares the cell's average color to the target blocks' color profiles in 3D color space, mapping each cell to the closest matching voxel block texture sheet.
*   **8-Bit RGB Color Quantization**: Clamps the color of the rendered texture sub-pixels into a 3-3-2 bit (8-bit) color depth, yielding exactly 256 colors total for that iconic, crunchy retro MS-DOS / Sega console look.

## 🛠️ Code Structure

The project has zero build chains, package managers, or bundlers:
- `index.html` - The structural shell of the skeuomorphic camera body, LCD HUD, and shutter controls.
- `css/style.css` - Custom styling tokens for brushed metal gradients, HUD text, and mobile viewport layouts.
- `js/filters.js` - Procedurally compiles block textures, maps colors, and applies 8-bit quantization.
- `js/app.js` - Orchestrates file streams, live camera feeds, drawing sequences, and PNG exports.
